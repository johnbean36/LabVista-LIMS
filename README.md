#### Detailed Description

LabVista is a Laboratory modern build of a LIMS(Laboratory Information Management System).  It allows a user to register samples, lookup samples by ID or by date. A user with elevated rights can validate the samples and create a report to be return to the customer.  I(John Bass) worked for 20 years in a laboratory so I have had lots of experience with what is needed for laboratory software.  I wanted to combine my experience in the the lab to highlight the knowledge I have gained as a software engineer.
